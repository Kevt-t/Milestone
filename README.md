**Problem Statement**
We validated the theme request and it shows that 67% of our users requested this feature.  we should build out the feature completely in our next release to support our user base. 

**Project Scope**
Create a form that allows the user to create a profile. The profile should take the user name, email, password & theme preference. Add a navigation menu to the top of the page with “Home” and Profile link. 

Center the navigation on the page. Validate the users name contains the required length of characters (a minimum of 4 characters). The name must be more than or equal to 4 characters in length. If the name is less than or equal to three characters in length, the form should hit a validation error. User settings should be stored in local storage 

The Theme should be added with a Radio button control or look similar to the toggle on the top right of your page. Add 3 or more additional themes to your project.
