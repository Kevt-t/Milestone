**Problem Statement**
We donâ€™t know how many users will use the theme button or if it is worth the time to build it. We should track how many requests we get for the button. 

**Project Scope**
Update the application to implement a theme. Create a form using JavaScript, when clicked, a form should popup and collect user data (email,  name, theme) and save it locally. Store the users preferences in Local Storage. Restore the selected theme when the application is loaded. Update the application logic to handle the click event for the theme.
