## Problem Statement
The previous YouTube Video project scope created several limitations based on user feedback. The layout does not provide a great user experience and should be improved to increase traffic to the site. 

## Project Scope
Create a page layout using a CSS grid that uses a main section that shows the main video that we want to play. There must be a placeholder section  below the main video that shows a list of 4 or 5 videos that can be selected to watch next.
